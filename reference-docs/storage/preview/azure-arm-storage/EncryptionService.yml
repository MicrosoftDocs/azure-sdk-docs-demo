      Gets a rough estimate of the date/time when the encryption was last
      enabled by the user. Only returned when encryption is enabled. There might
      be some unencrypted blobs which were written after this time, as it is
      just a rough estimate.

      NOTE: This property will not be serialized. It can only be populated by
      the server.
